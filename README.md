# EnrollMeUCSD
A simple program that makes use of Selenium to automate the enrollment process at UC San Diego. This program is intended to be used to "snipe" wait-list spots. 

## How It Works
This program takes in a list of section IDs and checks each ID with WebReg repeatedly until it is able to enroll in the section corresponding to the ID. It will repeatedly check each class until it can enroll in one or more class(es).

## Getting Started 
Coming Soon.

## TODO
- [ ] Automate login process in case WebReg logs out.

## Disclaimer
This program is a **proof-of-concept**. It is not designed for production use at this time. I strongly recommend not using this code as it is very prone to errors.
