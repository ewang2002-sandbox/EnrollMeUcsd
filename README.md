# EnrollMeUCSD
A simple program that makes use of Selenium to automate the enrollment process at UC San Diego.  

This program is a **proof-of-concept**. It is not designed for production use at this time. I strongly recommend not using this code as it is very prone to errors. 

I will continue to work on this project.

## How It Works
This program takes in a list of section IDs and checks each ID with WebReg repeatedly until it is able to enroll in the section corresponding to the ID. 

Effectively, it is spamming UCSD's WebReg system with search requests until it finds a section that you can enroll in.

## Disclaimer
I am not responsible for any consequences that may arise from your usage of this program. This program will spam the WebReg system unless modified; it is recommended that you modify it. 

## Getting Started 
Coming Soon.
